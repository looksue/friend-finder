# friend-finder
**How to run this app:** 
This app is deployed through Heroku. 

**Summary:**
This is a friend-finder app. The user must enter their name, a valid URL to their photo, and then complete the survey questions. The application will take the user's survey results and compare their answers with those from other users who have also taken the survey. The app will compare their results to all the other users and find the user with the closest survey score to them. The app will then display the results as a modal pop-up window containing the name and photo of the closest friend.
