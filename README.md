**How to run this app:** 
This app is deployed through Heroku. You must go to the link listed below to access it. Once there, you can 
click on the "Go to the Survey" link. Enter your name and a link to your photo image. Answer the survey questions by clicking on the number that best describes your answer on a scale from 1 to 5. Click on the Submit button. The app will calculate your new BFF based on the results that are closest to yours! The app will then show you the name and a picture of your new BFF! 

**Summary:**
This is a friend-finder app. The user must enter their name, a valid URL to their photo, and then complete the survey questions. The application will take the user's survey results and compare their answers with those from other users who have also taken the survey. The app will compare their results to all the other users and find the user with the closest survey score to them. The app will then display the results as a modal pop-up window containing the name and photo of the closest friend.
